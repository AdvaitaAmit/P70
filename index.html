Apart from the college canteen a food kiosk is functioning inside the campus which provides snacks and refreshments.The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more
                    efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared,
                    and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right
                    nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with
                    a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices
                    and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals
                    online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff

                    supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems
                    ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with
                    manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate
                    performance and payroll data. 
                    <br> 
                    2. <b> Economics: </b> Have you ever thought that attendance management systems
                    could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time
                    reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and
                    overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that
                    large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing
                    automated attendance management systems.
                    <br>
                    3. <b> Productivity / Efficiency: </b> Monitoring and managing attendance manually
                    can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to
                    process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and
                    overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with
                    an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee
                    hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time
                    and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of
                    resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits. And many
